What Is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the ongoing effort to protect individuals, organizations and governments from digital attacks by protecting networked systems and data from unauthorized use or harm.

Types of Organizational Data
-> Traditional Data1.2.1.1 Traditional Data
Traditional data is typically generated and maintained by all organizations, big and small. It includes the following:

Transactional data - such as details relating to buying and selling, production activities and basic organizational operations such as any information used to make employment decisions.
Intellectual property - such as patents, trademarks and new product plans, which allows an organization to gain economic advantage over its competitors. This information is often considered a trade secret and losing it could prove disastrous for the future of a company.
Financial data - such as income statements, balance sheets and cash flow statements, which provide insight into the health of a company.

Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data
IoT is a large network of physical objects, such as sensors, software and other equipment. All of these ‘things’ are connected to the Internet, with the ability to collect and share data. And given that storage options are expanding through the cloud and virtualization, it’s no surprise that the emergence of IoT has led to an exponential growth in data, creating a new area of interest in technology and business called 'Big Data.'

The Cube
The McCumber Cube is a model framework created by John McCumber in 1991 to help organizations establish and evaluate information security initiatives by considering all of the related factors that impact them. This security model has three dimensions:

1.  The foundational principles for protecting information systems.
2.  The protection of information in each of its possible states.
3.  The security measures used to protect data.
4.  Scroll down to find out more about the different elements of each dimension.


. Confidentiality is a set of rules that prevents sensitive information from being disclosed to unauthorized people, resources and processes. Methods to ensure confidentiality include data encryption, identity proofing and two factor authentication.

. Integrity ensures that system information or processes are protected from intentional or accidental modification. One way to ensure integrity is to use a hash function or checksum.

. Availability means that authorized users are able to access systems and data when and where needed and those that do not meet established conditions, are not. This can be achieved by maintaining equipment, performing hardware repairs, keeping operating systems and software up to date, and creating backups.

> Processing refers to data that is being used to perform an operation such as updating a database record (data in process).

> Storage refers to data stored in memory or on a permanent storage device such as a hard drive, solid-state drive or USB drive (data at rest).

> Transmission refers to data traveling between information systems (data in transit).

> Awareness, training and education are the measures put in place by an organization to ensure that users are knowledgeable about potential security threats and the actions they can take to protect information systems.

> Technology refers to the software- and hardware-based solutions designed to protect information systems such as firewalls, which continuously monitor your network in search of possible malicious incidents.

> Policy and procedure refers to the administrative controls that provide a foundation for how an organization implements information assurance, such as incident response plans and best practice guidelines.


**Attackers are individuals or groups who attempt to exploit vulnerability for personal or financial gain.**
Amateurs
The term 'script kiddies' emerged in thHackers
This group of attackers break into computer systems or networks to gain access. Depending on the intent of their break in, they can be classified as white, gray or black hat hackers.

White hat attackers break into networks or computer systems to identify any weaknesses so that the security of a system or network can be improved. These break-ins are done with prior permission and any results are reported back to the owner.
Gray hat attackers may set out to find vulnerabilities in a system but they will only report their findings to the owners of a system if doing so coincides with their agenda. Or they might even publish details about the vulnerability on the internet so that other attackers can exploit it.
Black hat attackers take advantage of any vulnerability for illegal personal, financial or political gain.
e 1990s and refers to amateur or inexperienced hackers who use existing tools or instructions found on the Internet to launch attacks. Some script kiddies are just curious, others are trying to demonstrate their skills and cause harm. While script kiddies may use basic tools, their attacks can still have devastating consequences.

Cyberwarfare, as its name suggests, is the use of technology to penetrate and attack another nation’s computer systems and networks in an effort to cause damage or disrupt services, such as shutting down a power grid.

The Purpose of Cyberwarfare

The main reason for resorting to cyberwarfare is to gain advantage over adversaries, whether they are nations or competitors.

Select the arrows to find out more about how cyberwarfare is used.

To impact another nation’s infrastructure
Besides industrial and military espionage, a nation can continuously invade another nation’s infrastructure in order to cause disruption and chaos.

For example, a cyber attack could shut down the power grid of a major city. Consider the consequences if this were to happen; roads would be congested, the exchange of goods and services would be halted, patients would not be able to get the care they would need if an emergency occurred, access to the internet would be interrupted. By shutting down a power grid, a cyber attack could have a huge impact on the everyday life of ordinary citizens.

Types of Malware
Cybercriminals use many different types of malicious software, or malware, to carry out their activities. Malware is any code that can be used to steal data, bypass access controls, or cause harm to or compromise a system. Knowing what the different types are and how they spread is key to containing and removing them.
